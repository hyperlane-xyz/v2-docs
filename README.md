# Overview

### What is Abacus?

Abacus is a developer platform that allows users to build cross-chain decentralized applications.

Applications built on top of Abacus can share state across multiple blockchains using Abacus'  generalized cross-chain messaging protocol.&#x20;

Abacus isn’t a blockchain. Abacus is how you build interchain applications.

### What problem does Abacus solve?

Abacus aims to make the "Which chain should I deploy on?" question obsolete.

In traditional web development, the choice of hosting environment is mostly an afterthought. While meaningful differences exist between cloud providers, the experience that the developer can deliver to their users is not meaningfully impacted by this choice.

On the other hand, a web3 developer's choice of hosting environment can have existential implications for them and their users. Decentralized applications have largely succeeded due to accessibility and composability, but applications are only accessible and composable within the chain on which they're deployed.

Until now.

We envision a world where developers think more about the application they're building than the substrate they're building it on. Where developers and applications are not tied to a single chain. Where developers can build applications that are accessible from everywhere, and composable with everything.

### How does Abacus work?

Abacus is a generalized messaging protocol that allows applications to communicate across blockchains.

With a simple smart contract call, Alice on Ethereum can send a message to Bob on Avalanche.

Abacus is [secured](protocol/security/) by a [proof-of-stake](protocol/security/proof-of-stake.md) validator set, combined with a novel approach to application-specific security we call [sovereign consensus](protocol/security/sovereign-consensus.md).
