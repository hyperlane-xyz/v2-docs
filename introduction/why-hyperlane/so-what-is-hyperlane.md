# So, what is Hyperlane?

If you've already read the [Introduction page](../../), you can skip below the graphic. Hyperlane is the first [permissionless interoperability](../../deploy/permissionless-interoperability.md) layer. Empowering developers to bring interoperability functionality to any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, a rollup, or an appchain. First of it's kind, Hyperlane is the only interoperability solution that can be [permissionlessly deployed](../../deploy/deploy-hyperlane/) on any chain, by anyone. With its modular architecture, notably its [sovereign-consensus](../../protocol/sovereign-consensus/ "mention"), Hyperlane gives developers control over their security model, and an ability to choose from a menu of options augmented by strong defaults.&#x20;

With Hyperlane deployed on their chains of choice developers can start building Interchain Applications, apps that can serve users on any chain connected to Hyperlane. [Handling](../../apis/messaging-api/receive.md) the burden of interoperability on behalf of their users, and offering a superior experience.&#x20;

[Building with Hyperlane ](../../build-with-hyperlane/quickstarts/)means access to innovative middlewares such as Hyperlane's [Warp Routes](../../apis/warp-api.md) that provide developers with the ability to port over assets to any chain while leveraging all of the unique features that emerge from Hyperlane's modular architecture.

Specifically, Hyperlane leverages its interchain messaging protocol to pass messages with arbitrary bytes between chains. These bytes can be anything from a function call on the destination chain, to an asset moving, to a string of text.

This diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a Hyperlane message:

Now that you have a better idea of what it is, you should also know what Hyperlane is not. It is not another token bridge, it is a network between blockchains. We call this network the Interchain Highway, it is the most accessible, secure, and fast route between the blockchains it connects. It can be used to offer token bridging, interchain function calls, and everything you think of when you think of interoperability.\
\
Hyperlane was built as a modular interoperability layer, with an architecture designed for the world of many smart contract environments, whether they are rollups (either generalized or app specific), appchains, and heterogenous layer 1 blockchains (monolithic or not). Specifically, it was built to be [permissionless](../../deploy/permissionless-interoperability.md). The view at the Hyperlane core team is that there will be far too many chains to be covered by any single team, and that the current permissioned state of interoperability solutions is untenable and unsuitable for where the ecosystem is headed. &#x20;

Additionally Hyperlane was purpose built with flexibility and future proofing in mind. The modular nature of the platform means it can adapt to the fast moving and evolutionary nature of Crypto. Developers choosing Hyperlane can rest assured that Hyperlane will evolve with the industry, with their chains of choice and with their applications.&#x20;

Note: that Hyperlane can support any smart contract environment, and in the course of these docs the term blockchain or chain will be used where rollup or appchain are often equally suitable.&#x20;
